My school, like many, uses a weighted system for GPA calculation. Only problem is, they don't let us see our GPA, ever, except on one final report card at the very end of the year. They do, however, very "graciously" provide us with a GPA Calculation worksheet that gives us step-by-step instructions on how to just do it ourselves. The problem? The worksheet is long, repetitive, and incredibly tedious. Plus, it's a pain to redo it again and again and again every time a grade changes, because one letter grade up or down screws the whole calculation up. 
Online GPA calculators are often unreliable, and even if they're not, one still has to type in every single one of your grades every time you visit one.

So, here's my solution:

# GPACalc!

## What is it?

GPACalc is a simple functional GPACalculator that accurately provides a student's weighted GPA. Except, that's not all. GPACalc additionally has a working login system that allows you to save all your info with one click of a button, therefore completely eliminating the cumbersome, repetitive act of filling out all your information.

## How does it work?

Simply sign up and log in with any username and password. To create a new class, click the "create class" button. Fill out a name, then the necessary information-- CP/Honors/AP, letter grade, and semester/full-year. Add all classes. To calculate GPA, just click "Calculate Weighted GPA", and the website will display it. Before closing the website, ensure the "Save" button has been clicked. This is important! Data will not be saved otherwise.
